Want to create data-driven web applications? AngularJS is a great choice. It allows you to build apps where multiple users can push and pull data at the same time, in real time. However, while the framework is easy to learn, it can be tough to master. This course is the second in a two-part series designed to show you how Angular works in the real world. It takes up where AngularJS 1: Adding Registration to Your Application left off: a simple application that checks users in and out of meetings. Here, instructor and Angular advocate Ray Villalobos shows how to enhance the existing app with new views and controllers to reward random checked-in users with prizes.

Learn how to create forms, edit database records, create methods, randomize record selections, and style and secure your app. With these project-based lessons, you'll learn how to see how data-driven programming with AngularJS can help your apps react to real-time data streams.

## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage. Or you can simply add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to peek at. 

## Branches
The branches are structured so that they correspond to the videos in the course. So, for example if I name a branch `02_03b` then that branch corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. The extra letter at the end of the name corresponds to the state of the branch. A `b` means that this is how the code looks at the beginning of the video, an `e` means that is how the code looked at the end of the video.

You may find additional branches that correspond to other states, so for example, you may see a `t`, which means this is a target branch. A target branch is something I use during development or updates of a course and it's for a branch that I'm working towards. For the purposes of taking a course, you may ignore any additional branches. The `master` branch usually has the state of the project as I'm working through it and the final state of the code when I finish the course.
